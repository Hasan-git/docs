## <Icon icon="face-viewfinder" /> Overview

The **Operation** section provides a dedicated space to record procedures performed as part of managing a patient's condition. Whether surgical or non-surgical, this section helps track what was done, when it was done, and why. By linking operations to specific conditions, providers can maintain a clear and organized history of clinical interventions.

## <Icon icon="question" /> When to use?

Use the **Operation** module when a patient undergoes any medical or surgical procedure related to a documented condition. This includes planned surgeries, in-clinic procedures, or interventions that require recording for clinical, legal, or billing purposes. It ensures all procedures are properly tracked and associated with the relevant diagnosis.
