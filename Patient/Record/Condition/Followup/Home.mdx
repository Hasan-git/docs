description: "The Follow-up module in MedRay is used to track and manage ongoing care related to a specific patient condition. After a condition is created, follow-ups allow providers to schedule review visits, monitor progress, document treatment outcomes, and ensure continuity of care. Each follow-up is linked to its parent condition and includes clinical notes, planned actions, and scheduled dates. Follow-ups help maintain a clear medical timeline and ensure that no important step in the patientâ€™s treatment is missed.ption of your new file."
