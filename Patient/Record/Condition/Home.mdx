- Track symptoms, progress, and response to treatment

- Link to related forms, media, or lab results

## 🏥 Operations

Keep a clear record of any procedures:

- Log surgery details (type, date, notes)

- Attach post-op reports and related media

- View operation history as part of the full patient timeline

\> 📆 This helps doctors stay informed and plan better care for future visits.
