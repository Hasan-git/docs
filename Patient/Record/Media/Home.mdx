## Introduction

The **Media** section of the EMR system allows doctors to store, view, and manage all types of medical files associated with a patient. This includes images (e.g., X-rays, ultrasounds), documents (e.g., referral letters, discharge summaries), videos (e.g., procedure recordings), and audio notes. Each file is securely stored and linked to specific visits, forms, or diagnoses, helping healthcare providers quickly reference critical visual or supplementary data.
