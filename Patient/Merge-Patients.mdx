## 🔗 Merge Patients

Sometimes, the same patient might be entered more than once by mistake. The **Merge Patients** feature helps you fix that by combining duplicate records into a single, clean profile.

## What it does

- Keeps **one unified record** for the patient
- Merges visits, forms, media, and conditions
- Prevents confusion and improves data accuracy

\> ⚠️ Don’t worry — nothing is deleted. You’ll choose which details to keep when merging.
