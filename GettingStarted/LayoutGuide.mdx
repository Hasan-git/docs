### Sidebar Menu (Main Modules)

Located on the left-hand side, the sidebar is your primary navigation tool. It includes:

- **Patient File** – View, create, and manage full patient medical records
- **Contact File** – Manage individuals who are not yet full patients
- **Schedule** – Schedule, view, and update all clinic appointments
- \*\*Settings \*\* – Configure clinic-wide preferences and system behavior

    style={{ width:"47%" }}
  />

<Tip>
  Access to the **Settings** module is restricted by default. The **Admin** has the authority to grant or revoke permission for other users to access system settings based on their roles and responsibilities.

  />

  The red **gear icon** on the bottom-right corner opens the Interface Settings panel, allowing users to personalize their workspace. Options include:
- **Theme** –Choose a color style that suits your workflow
- **Layout** – Modify interface structure for personal preference

    > These changes affect only the current user’s view and do not impact system-wide settings.
  </Tip>

### In-Page Navigation

Inside each module, navigation tabs help you move between sections. For example:

- In **Patient File**, tabs might include: Personal Info, Medical History, Visits, Documents
- In **Appointments**, tabs may separate Scheduled, Completed, and Canceled visits
